物权凭证

1、Nemo dat quod non habet/nemo dat
literally meaning "no one [can] give what they don't have" is a legal rule, sometimes called the nemo dat rule 
that states that the purchase of a possession from someone who has no ownership right to it also denies the 
purchaser any ownership title.This rule usually stays valid even if the purchaser does not know that the seller
has no right to claim ownership of the object of the transaction (bona fide). 

1）usu :没有货权的中间商签发的第二套提单
  中间商签发BL,交给FOB卖方。发货人会稍后结汇->
  为了多争取时间，加快资金流通和多赚取利息->
  中间商又会签发自己为发货人的提单，CIF价格开给买方信用证结汇-> 
  此时中间商并未拥有货物主权,若是中间商突然倒闭||中间商以单证不符为由拒绝支付发货人->
  中国FOB卖方与外国CIF买方争抢货物->
  根据此规则，货物主权为FOB买方
  
2）exp: buyer in possession
